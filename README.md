# Summary
This set of Matlab codes reproduce the figures and experimental results published in our paper: 
> **Subgradient Descent Learns Orthogonal Dictionaries**.   
> Yu Bai, Qijia Jiang, Ju Sun. https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10702. 

+ The M files **subgrad_ident.m** and **subgrad_ortho.m**: implement the Riemannian subgradient descent algorithm and reproduce Figure 1. 
+ The M file **solver_granso.m**: implement the nonsmooth BFGS method based on the [GRANSO package](http://www.timmitchell.com/software/GRANSO/) (version 1.6). 

Codes written by Qijia Jiang and Ju Sun. Questions or bug reports please send email to Ju Sun, sunjunus@gmail.com
